### Ubiquity

Screens are embedded into daily life so deeply that it barely registers. From phones to laptops, watches to car dashboards — nearly every surface glows now. It's not surprising anymore to see someone tapping through a grocery list on their phone while glancing at a smartwatch notification. Even gas pumps have mini-screens playing ads.

The strange part is how normalized it all feels. People wake up to alarms on screens, work eight hours staring at one, then unwind with another screen in hand. There's barely a transition. You finish writing code and two seconds later you're watching a video review of a backpack or scrolling through endless comments on something you don’t care about.

### Dependence

It’s not necessarily dystopian — screens aren’t evil — but there’s a blur between usage and dependence. You might start the day checking the weather and end up doomscrolling in bed hours later. There’s no clear off-ramp unless you intentionally build one.

Ironically, people are now building tools _on_ screens to help them use screens _less_. Screen time trackers, focus modes, grayscale toggles — digital tools to fight digital fatigue. But it’s like trying to diet in a candy store. The tools are helpful, sure. But the environment always wins unless you redesign it.

That said, a well-used screen still beats the alternative. Reading on a Kindle at night is better than squinting at tiny book text under a lamp. A quick video call solves more than three emails. The problem isn’t the screen — it’s the lack of friction between intention and distraction.
